Scaled Up Web Infrastructure Design (4 Servers + HA Load Balancer)

Infrastructure Components:

Server 1: Load Balancer Primary
- HAProxy Load Balancer (Primary)
- SSL Certificate management
- Firewall
- Monitoring Client

Server 2: Load Balancer Secondary  
- HAProxy Load Balancer (Secondary - clustered with primary)
- SSL Certificate management
- Firewall
- Monitoring Client

Server 3: Web Server (Dedicated)
- Nginx Web Server only
- SSL certificates for backend communication
- Firewall
- Monitoring Client

Server 4: Application Server (Dedicated)
- Application Server only
- Application Files (Code Base)
- Business logic processing
- Firewall  
- Monitoring Client

Server 5: Database Server (Dedicated)
- MySQL Database (Primary)
- Database replication setup
- Dedicated storage and backup
- Firewall
- Monitoring Client

Why Each Additional Element is Added:

1. Additional Server:
   - Enables component separation for better performance
   - Dedicated resources for each service type
   - Better scalability and maintenance
   - Reduced resource contention

2. Load Balancer Cluster (HAProxy):
   - Eliminates single point of failure for load balancing
   - High availability through active-passive or active-active setup
   - Seamless failover between load balancers
   - Improved reliability and uptime

3. Component Separation:

   Web Server (Dedicated):
   - Optimized for serving static content
   - Better SSL/TLS performance
   - Improved caching capabilities
   - Reduced memory footprint

   Application Server (Dedicated):  
   - Optimized for business logic processing
   - Better resource allocation for CPU-intensive tasks
   - Easier scaling based on application load
   - Improved security isolation

   Database Server (Dedicated):
   - Optimized for data storage and retrieval
   - Better I/O performance with dedicated storage
   - Enhanced security for sensitive data
   - Easier database maintenance and backup

Benefits of This Architecture:

1. High Availability:
   - No single point of failure
   - Redundant load balancers
   - Component isolation prevents cascade failures

2. Scalability:
   - Each component can be scaled independently
   - Easy to add more web or application servers
   - Database can be scaled with read replicas

3. Performance:
   - Dedicated resources for each service
   - Optimized configurations per component
   - Better resource utilization

4. Maintenance:
   - Components can be updated independently
   - Rolling deployments possible
   - Reduced downtime during maintenance

5. Security:
   - Better isolation between components
   - Granular firewall rules per service
   - Reduced attack surface per server

Load Balancer Clustering:
- Active-Passive setup with heartbeat monitoring
- Automatic failover in case of primary failure
- Shared configuration and SSL certificates
- Virtual IP (VIP) for seamless switching
